# Employee Management System

## Project Description

The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a Java-based application that demonstrates the use of three design patterns: Singleton, Builder, and Factory. The EMS allows adding, removing, and managing employees in a company using an intuitive command-line interface.

## Features
- Add new employees (Full-time or Part-time).
- Remove employees by their ID.
- View all employees or a specific employee by ID.
- Track employee working hours and salary.

## Design Patterns Used
- **Singleton**: Ensures only one instance of `EmployeeManager` exists throughout the program.
- **Builder**: Provides a flexible way to build `Employee` objects step by step.
- **Factory**: Creates instances of `Employee` subclasses (FullTime and PartTime).

## How to Run the Project
